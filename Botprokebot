# Pseudocode for Deriv Binary Bot or Custom Trading Bot
# Trading Logic: Trade if the last digit is above 5, no trade if it is 5 or below.

# Define variables
trade_amount = 1  # amount to trade per position (adjust as needed)
max_loss = 5  # max amount you're willing to lose
current_loss = 0  # track losses
trade_count = 0  # count trades to avoid overtrading

def last_digit(price):
    # Extract the last digit of the price
    last_digit = int(str(price)[-1])
    return last_digit

def should_trade(last_digit):
    # Decision rule: Trade if the last digit is greater than 5
    return last_digit > 5

def place_trade():
    # Simulate placing a trade (will depend on API or trading platform)
    # For example, buy or sell on Deriv depending on last digit condition
    print("Placing trade with amount:", trade_amount)

def check_loss():
    # Check if current loss exceeds max loss
    global current_loss
    if current_loss >= max_loss:
        print("Max loss reached. Stopping trading.")
        return True
    return False

    # Example: Get the latest market price (replace with API or data call)
    market_price = get_market_price()

    # Get last digit of market price
    last_digit = last_digit(market_price)
    print(f"Last digit of price: {last_digit}")

    # Only place a trade if the last digit is over 5
    if should_trade(last_digit):
        print(f"Conditions met: Trading with {trade_amount}")
        place_trade()
        trade_count += 1
    else:
        print("Last digit is not over 5, no trade placed.")

    # Update loss and check if we need to stop
    if check_loss():
        print("Ending trading session.")

    # Simulate trading results and update loss (you will need to track actual profit/loss)
